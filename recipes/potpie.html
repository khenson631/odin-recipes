    <p>What is a classic chicken pot pie? It starts with a scratch sauce that’s made easily with just a few ingredients. The fresh, flavorful sauce becomes the rich and luscious savory pie filling when mixed with cooked chicken and veggies. All this goodness gets tucked inside tender, flaky pie crust, for a decadent homemade chicken pot pie that beckons all to the table. It’s a perfect dinner to serve when the nights turn cold, as its comforting qualities warm you from the inside out.</p>
